## What is HuskEats?

   HuskEats is an application specifically built for Northeastern students to dicuss, share, and rate resteraunts around the Northeastern area, as well as mark their favorite resteraunts. 
   This application will be named HuskEats, and will allow users to not only review resteraunts, but also provide a forum space for users to talk about resteraunts, review them, and answer reviews as well.
   This application will also allow resteraunt owners to view and reply to reviews on their resteraunts, update all of their resteraunt's information such as hours, address, menu hours, etc, and check their resteraunt's rating.
   This application will also allow advertisers to Upload, Manage, and Edit their advertisements on the application to allow the application to make money and for advertisers to have control in how they are publishing their product.
   This application will have administrator users as well, who can check User Statistics, Approve Resteraunts to be listed on the main application page for all users to find, and check Ad Revenue for advertisers who will request data.
   This application will also have a home page specific to every user to allow users to navigate between different tasks that they wish to accomplish.
